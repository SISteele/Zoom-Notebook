<h1>Zoom Notebook </h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
A group UX design project developed from January through May 2021, the goal of which was to design a notebook attachment for educational Zoom environments usable for both students and educators.
<h2>Developers:</h2>
Savannah Steele, Dillon Loubser, Julia Scott, Chris Drmacich, and Bryan Shin

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
For the Spring 2021 semester at the University of Georgia, Dr. Michael Cotterell's CSCI 4800 (Human-Computer Interaction) course set students with the goal to develop an application related to hybrid synchronous intruction. After being divided into teams, students were to develop and propose a concept, create wireframes, make mockups, and prototype the app for others to use.


<h2>Milestone #1 - Proposal:</h2>
After being given the theme of hybrid synchronous instruction, our team brainstormed a few ideas of what our app proposal would be. Our focus for this theme was to develop an app that would improve student focus during online class sessions, as many of us have dealt with issues with our ability to pay attention in online educational platforms. Proposals ranged from gamifying class settings on Zoom to a quiz feature on Zoom. Our final proposal was a note taking app wherein students would be able to write notes inside of Zoom and save and load previous notes while also allowing teachers to be able to track student activity. By allowing teachers to see how often students use their notes, they can accomodate for and reach out to students with low activity rates to find ways to enhance their education. The benefit for students would be a note app that they can use without tabbing out of Zoom, making sure they don't miss critical information being shown on the page. 

<h2>Milestone #2 - User Stories:</h2>
After finalizing our project proposal, we moved onto user stories. For this product we had two main categories: students and teachers. For students we determined these were the following desires for those that wanted to take notes.

* As a student, I want to type out my notes so that my notes are orderly and easy to read

    - As a student, I want to write my notes by hand so that I can write my notes in my own style
    
    - As a student, I want to insert illustrations in my notes so that my notes are comprehensive and have all the information I want in one place
    
    - As a student I want to use multiple colors in my notes so that my notes are organized and easy for me to read.
    
* As a student, I want to save my notes so that I can review the material later

    - As a student, I want to be able to edit my notes so that I can make corrections as needed

And then for teachers the following stories were picked.

* As a teacher I want to be able to check on student participation so I can check on those that are struggling with the class and help them stay focused
    - As a teacher, I want to view a particular studentâ€™s notes.
    
    - As a teacher, I want to check when a student last interacted with their notes.

After creating the base stories, the below were considered to be the most important.

* As a student, I want to type out my notes so that my notes are orderly and easy to read

    - Justification: The basis of our solution is actually having an editor for students to interact with in order to record their notes. This can be done in a variety of ways, like through typing out or handwriting notes, and it has been found that being able to have different types of notetaking available is helpful for learning. In addition to this, there should be standard modern document editors like a button that inserts images or shapes, as well as options for changing font colors and options like bold and underline.

* As a student, I want to save my notes so that I can review the material later

    - Justification: A significant portion of our proposal involves the use of our program as a notes program. Without the functionality of saving and accessing notes documents within the app, users would have to go through extra steps to download their notes when they finish and the solution becomes more complicated than it needs to be. Also, in the same vein of the importance of taking the notes, having the ability to save notes is also just as important.

* As a teacher I want to be able to check on student participation so I can check on those that are struggling with the class and help them stay focused

    - Justification: Part of our proposed solution was to provide teachers with the functionality to keep track of their students. This user story covers all the functionality a teacher needs and therefore is very relevant. There is also precedent, which can be found through sites online, of teachers having a problem with participation and needing solutions, so putting one within the notes functionality is very relevant.
